# Customer Support & Managed Network Service Improvement  
**IT Support | Incident Management | Service Operations**

## Overview

This project documents a service improvement initiative focused on enhancing customer support operations for a managed network service environment.

The work was carried out as part of IT support responsibilities at **VAS Technologies Ltd**, which provided managed network services for a **nationwide government agency** operating multiple regional sites connected to a central system.

The goal of the initiative was to reduce response times, improve issue tracking, and enhance communication during network incidents.

---

## Operational Context

VAS Technologies Ltd provided managed network support for a government organization with:

- Multiple regional offices and operational centers across different states  
- Secure connectivity between regional sites and a central database  
- High availability requirements due to the critical nature of services  

Network incidents at any site had direct operational impact and required timely response, clear communication, and proper escalation.

---

## Problem Statement

Before this initiative, customer support operations faced several challenges:

- Incident reports were logged manually using spreadsheets  
- Tracking recurring issues across sites was difficult  
- Response and escalation timelines were inconsistent  
- Communication with affected sites during outages was fragmented  
- Support staff spent significant time handling repetitive requests  

These issues led to slower resolution times and reduced service visibility.

---

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this initiative were to:

- Improve response time for network and system incidents  
- Standardize issue logging and tracking  
- Reduce manual effort for repetitive support requests  
- Improve escalation handling for ISP-related issues  
- Enhance communication with supported sites during incidents  

---

## Scope of Work

This project focused on **support operations and process improvement**, including:

- Incident intake and logging  
- Ticket categorization and prioritization  
- Escalation workflows  
- Customer communication and feedback  
- Reporting and service visibility  

It did not involve changes to the underlying network architecture.

## Approach & Implementation

### 1. Incident Handling Review

- Reviewed existing incident handling processes  
- Identified inefficiencies caused by manual logging and follow-ups  
- Analyzed common support requests and escalation patterns  

---

### 2. Ticketing System Implementation

- Implemented **Freshdesk** as a centralized ticketing platform  
- Configured ticket categories based on issue types  
- Introduced priority levels for critical incidents  
- Ensured all incidents were logged and trackable  

---

### 3. Automation & Self-Service Enablement

- Designed automated responses for common issues  
- Created basic self-help resources to reduce repetitive inquiries  
- Reduced manual workload for first-line support staff  

---

### 4. Escalation & Communication Workflow

- Defined clear escalation paths for ISP-related outages  
- Ensured urgent incidents were flagged and acted on quickly  
- Maintained communication with affected sites during outages  
- Provided updates until issues were fully resolved  

---

### 5. Feedback & Continuous Improvement

- Monitored ticket trends and response times  
- Reviewed customer feedback and satisfaction metrics  
- Made iterative improvements to workflows and automation
